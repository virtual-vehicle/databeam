<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A module receiving real time data from another module and performing a real time filtering technique on its selected channels.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Input Module:</b> The string of the livedata topic to receive from [module_name/topic_name/rate],
                           where rate is either liveall, or livedec.</li>
  <li><b>Channels:</b> A string list of all channels to filter and output of the subscribed module/topic.</li>
  <li><b>Timebase:</b> The number of previous samples to account for in the filter. Can be set to samples (sample number) or time (seconds).</li>
  <li><b>Timebase Value [samples/sec]:</b> The value representing the used filtering window. Can be sample number, time in seconds, or
    some other parameter (e.g. remembering constant tau). All have the same effect, that a higher value leads to more smoothing, but also more lagging.</li>
  <li><b>Method:</b> The type of filter to apply to the received data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method Formulas</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Average:</b> A simple moving average filter, which averages for every timestep all N previous datapoints (samples)
    or all previous datapoints inside the last T seconds (time).</li>
  <li><b>Exponential Average:</b> An exponentially decaying moving average. Utilizes a smooting factor alpha to combine every new
    datapoint with the previous ones, as can be read here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing">Wikipedia Source</a></li>.
    If timebase is set to time, the timebase value does not represent the window size anymore, but the a remembering constant tau.
    This allows to account previous samples which arrive irregularly and weight them based on the time passed since the current datapoint.
    Tau then represents the impact previous values still have on the current datapoint. Higher tau leads to more smoothing, but also more lagging.
  <li><b>Median:</b> A simple moving median filter, which takes the median for every timestep of all N previous datapoints (samples)
    or of all previous datapoints inside the last T seconds (time).</li>
</ul>
